# If you want to pass a common option to all daemons, you can use the

# The list of daemons to watch is automatically generated by the init script.
# This variable can be used to pass options to watchfrr that will be passed
# prior to the daemon list.
#
# To make watchfrr create/join the specified netns, add the the "--netns"
# option here. It will only have an effect in /etc/frr/<somename>/daemons, and
# you need to start FRR with "/usr/lib/frr/frrinit.sh start <somename>".

# This is the maximum number of FD's that will be available.  Upon startup this
# is read by the control files and ulimit is called.  Uncomment and use a
# reasonable value for your setup if you are expecting a large number of peers

# Uncomment this option if you want to run FRR as a non-root user. Note that
# you should know what you are doing since most of the daemons need root
# to work. This could be useful if you want to run FRR in a container
# for instance.

# For any daemon, you can specify a "wrap" command to start instead of starting
# the daemon directly. This will simply be prepended to the daemon invocation.
# These variables have the form daemon_wrap, where 'daemon' is the name of the
# daemon (the same pattern as the daemon_options variables).
#
# Note that when daemons are started, they are told to daemonize with the `-d`
# option. This has several implications. For one, the init script expects that
# when it invokes a daemon, the invocation returns immediately. If you add a
# wrap command here, it must comply with this expectation and daemonize as
# well, or the init script will never return. Furthermore, because daemons are
# themselves daemonized with -d, you must ensure that your wrapper command is
# capable of following child processes after a fork() if you need it to do so.
#
# If your desired wrapper does not support daemonization, you can wrap it with
# a utility program that daemonizes programs, such as 'daemonize'. An example
# of this might look like:
#
# bgpd_wrap="/usr/bin/daemonize /usr/bin/mywrapper"
#
# This is particularly useful for programs which record processes but lack
# daemonization options, such as perf and rr.
#
# If you wish to wrap all daemons in the same way, you may set the "all_wrap"
# variable.
